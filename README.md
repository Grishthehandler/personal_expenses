"""
This project aims to simulate an expenses tracker of an individual using the Faker library.
Create sql queries to derive insights into spending behaviour.
A streamlit app is developed to visualize these insights and showcase the result of sql queries.
The tracker will highlight the expenses across categories like "Food", "Transportation", "Bills", "Groceries", "Subscriptions",
and personal spending providing a comprehensive overview of financial habits over a year.
